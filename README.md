# Discord Favorite GIF Exporter

**A simple, lightweight script to quickly export your favorited GIFs from Discord into a JSON file.**

## Why this exists

I made this because I couldn't find something simple and straightforward, way to back up my Discord favorite GIFs online. If you're switching Discord accounts or just want a local list of your favorite GIF collection, this script does exactly that in seconds.

## Prerequisites

To use this script, you must be using one of the following Discord client mods:

* **Vencord** (Recommended)
* **Equicord** (or any other Vencord fork)

## How to Use

1. Open your Discord desktop client.
2. Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` to open the **Developer Tools**.
3. Click on the **Console** tab.
4. Copy and paste the code from `Favorite_gifs.js` into the console and hit `Enter`.
5. A file named `favorite_gifs.json` will automatically download containing all your GIF URLs.
